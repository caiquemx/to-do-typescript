## Leasons Learned
  Is very challenging to learn a new framework or/and library, but a new language is even more. 
  In this project I put all of these tecnologies together to see how it goes.
  I think it went really well, although learning new things is exciting, learning new ways of thinking in a problem resolution
  is even more exciting. I can say that typescript is complex and hard at first, but it opens your mind for a whole new way to make something "right".
